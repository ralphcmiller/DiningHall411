# DiningHall411
Dining Hall 411 will seek to provide easily accessible UCSC dining hall menu information through an SMS messaging system to students. Users will be able to receive the menu of any dining hall on campus on the fly, with the ability to track favorite meals, as well as sort by allergens and other dietary restrictions.
